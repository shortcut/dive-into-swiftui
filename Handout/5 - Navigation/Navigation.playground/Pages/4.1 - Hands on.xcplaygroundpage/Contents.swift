 # Hands on

 The project is currently using `NavigationView`, so for this exercise we're going to update the to using the new `NavigationStack`, and then add some navigation features.

 - Replace all of the `NavigationView`s with `NavigationStack`s
 - Set up viewing an item from the `SearchView`
 - Add the ability to push to an image URL on the DetailView
 - Add the navigation actions from the FavoritesView
