/*: # Application 

 The first advantage of @ViewBuilder is eliminating the need for the `return` keyword, any child view being automatically returned, but there are multiple scenarios in which you could use the attribute and here are some we found useful:
 1. [Creating multiple child views](2.1%20-%20Multiple%20child%20views);
 2. [Being able to return multiple subtypes of `View` in the same block of code](2.2%20-%20Multiple%20return%20types);
 3. [Passing body-like structure of child views with methods/ initializers](2.3%20-%20Methods%20attribute);
 4. [Passing body-like structure of child views with properties](2.4%20-%20Property%20attribute);
 5. [Method definitions](2.5%20-%20Method%20definitions);
 6. [Optional views](2.6%20-%20Failable%20Initializers).

 In the next subchapters, we will better explain and exemplify how every scenario is used.
