/*: # Conclusions

 The @ViewBuilder attribute allows you to define the body of a SwiftUI view without using a return keyword in front of every view. You can use the result builder inside initializers, method definitions, or in front of properties, but don't add more than 10 views at a time.

 Using the result builder attribute, you can create more compact code and improve readability.
