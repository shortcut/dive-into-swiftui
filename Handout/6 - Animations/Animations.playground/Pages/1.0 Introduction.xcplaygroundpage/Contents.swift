 # Animations

 One of the marquee features of SwiftUI is the ability to easily add animations. To be able to work with SwiftUI animations, it's important to understand how the engine that drives the animations works. This includes understanding view identity in SwiftUI, how to explicitly and implicitly add animations when a value changes, how to override animations using transactions, how to use transitions to animate views moving in and out of the view hierarchy, and how to use `MatchedGeometryEffect` to have SwiftUI animate between different views.
