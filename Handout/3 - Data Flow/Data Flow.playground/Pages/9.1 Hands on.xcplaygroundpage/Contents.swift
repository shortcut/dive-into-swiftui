 ## Hands on

 So now that we've discussed how data moves through the view hierarchy in SwiftUI, lets put that to use by improving the sample project.

 You can search for "Chapter 3" to quickly find signposts that point to where to make changes.

 The main exercise for this section is using Environment and Preference keys to align the two columns in the `DetailView`

 If you finish that early, we have three bonus challenges here.
 - Create a parallax scrolling effect
 - Create a scaling "bounce" scroll effect
 - Create a text view that clips after a certain number of lines, and if it clips, allow the user to expand / hide the text with a button
