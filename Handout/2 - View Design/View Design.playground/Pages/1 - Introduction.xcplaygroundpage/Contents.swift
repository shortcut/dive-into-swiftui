/*: View Design
 
 In this chapter we want to explore some advanced tools that `SwiftUI` offers to help with customizing the way your `Views` interact, align and how we can shift the paradigm of reusability from big components to small ones.
 
 Throughout our journey as `UIKit` developers we've been used to dealing with constraints, size computations, frame computations and we could setup a proportional constraints relative to other `UIViews`. That is not so obvious in `SwiftUI` and we want to showcase some of your options when dealing with more complex design logic.
 
 Next, we'll see what adaptive Layout means, how to use it and where it's suited best in our quest to can better display information when taking accessibility and/ or screen size into account.
