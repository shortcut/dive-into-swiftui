 # Code Design

 In this chapter, we'll be talking about how to structure you code. This includes on making re-usable code using components, separating your view code from other code using view models, understanding how to properly work with `@StateObject` and `@ObservableObject`, and how to use the structured concurrency.

  This is meant to help you think about how to structure your code, and it isn't meant to be a guide for the "right" way to structure code, as the right answer will vary depending on needs of the project.
